# First Project: End-to-end Data Analysis

A data project lifecycle consists of multiple interconnected phases, spanning from data cleaning and exploration to advanced analysis and reporting. 
In this project, you will experience the end-to-end process of performing a comprehensive data analysis. By combining the strengths of Python for data manipulation and exploration, 
you will gain a deeper understanding of how these tools complement each other in real-world scenarios.The objective is not only to answer business questions but also to critically engage with the data—cleaning, 
structuring, exploring patterns, and visualizing findings before translating them into actionable insights.

# Project Overview
- **Pick a topic and choose a dataset.**
- **Data Analysis**: Understand your dataset and create a report (e.g., Word document) summarizing it.
- **Data Exploration and Business Understanding**

## Dataset Sources:
- Kaggle
- Machine Learning Repository
- PorData
- datahub.io
  
## Bonus Points
- Augment your data with web scraping.
- Include visualizations from Python and/or Tableau in the final presentation.
- Apply statistical tests like Chi-Square or others if they make sense.
- Automate tasks with Python scripts, such as cleaning steps.
- Add a dashboard for data visualization.
- Use SQL to create a database with your data.


## Mandatory Deliverables
- **Presentation**: 8–15 minutes per person.
- **Python Code**: Well-documented Python script covering:
  - At least one use of lambda, apply...
  - At least two groupby operations and aggregations.
  - At least one frequency table.
- **Visualization**: Minimum of three plots showcasing univariate and multivariate analysis (bonus to do it also in Tableau dashboard).
- **README File**: A comprehensive README explaining the project, dataset, methodology, and results.
